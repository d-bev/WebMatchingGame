Debug Commit

	F12's console output
	Added this changelog 
	
Debug Commit 2
	Added some more annotations
	Added base end-game functions (isGameOver(), displayGameEnd())
	DISCOVERED BUG BEHAVIOR: the game only breaks upon checking a vertical match of 3
		Yet, the debug tool points us two the function for determining a valid vertical match of 4
		Debug tool claims error resides in 'syntax error' that is not present
	Currently working on locking/deleting the game board after a game has been one or lost (deleteBoard())

Debug Commit 3
	Added replaceCandies(), allowing for technically-infinite board play in the absence of a win condition (and lose condition)
	All Functional Requirements for WPD2 are met with this commit
	
Debug Commit 4
	Added basic CSS stylings to make the web page easier to look at
	Bug is unresolved, but the behavior has been confirmed

Debug Resolution
	I AM BETTER THAN YOU ANIA KUBOW AND I DESERVE ALL OF YOUR SUBSCRIBERS:
		4-5 serious off-by-one errors when considering error cases in valid matches
		Neglecting of array's end-case --> the bottom right square was unmatchable
	Probably not even forklift certified, moron.
