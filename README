Project name: 

	Operation: O.L.I.V.A.R.E.S.

Description: 

	The final project will be a matching game (like Candy Crush and Bejeweled), but played in a browser. The game will implement full-stack javascript in order to implement typical game functions (i.e saving a profileâ€™s progress on a database). This project was originally a school project, but will become something I plan to continuously work on. Thus community help is encouraged.

Installation: 

	Download files from GitHub
	Game requires installations of:
		npm	(NodeProjectManager)
		For Dependencies of:
			"bcrypt": "^5.0.1",
			"body-parser": "^1.19.0",
			"ejs": "^3.1.6",
			"ejs-lint": "^1.2.1",
			"express": "^4.17.1",
			"express-session": "^1.17.2",
			"mongo-sanitize": "^1.1.0",
			"mongodb": "^4.2.0",
			"mongoose": "^6.0.13",
			"sanitize": "^2.1.0",
			"underscore": "^1.13.1",
			"validatorjs": "^3.22.1"

	Installations may be required for:
		Basic Javascript				(For JSON functionality)
		Basic NodeJS					(For downloading npm and modules)
		HTTP							(Web Module)

Usage: 

	Static Version 	(No database integration, essentially for demonstration pruposes):
		simply open index.html (found in the 'static' subfolder) in a browser. Chrome and Firefox are preferable for stability.

	Full Version	(Full databse integration):
		No .exe file exists.
		You can launch the game by running "node index.js" in an appropriate terminal.
		You can also configure a launch.json file and use that to launch the game instead.

Contributing: 

	No real requirements, a simple encapsulating commit message is enough as long as your code is easily understandable (labeled, explanatory comments, etc).
	That being said, please don't over-explain (comments are cluttering code): if changes are in depth, feel free to add details to CHANGELOG, or make a post in the repository.
